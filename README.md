I'm just checking the process of creating a fork, updating my fork, then creating a pull request from within Android Studio
#Gareth's stuff:
1. Go to Angelsone on GitHub
2. Fork the test-1 project - this adds a fork into my repository
3. Get the git address of my fork
4. In Android Studio, add from VCS and enter the git address
5. Build as Gradle (this was a test file, so not strictly necessary, but done anyway)
6. Add VCS root (popup notification) and create .gitignore.
7. Edit the .gitignore file to include    .idea/
8. Make changes to whatever files need changed (in this case, README.md)
9. Commit and push the changes to my repository (master -> origin/master)
10. VCS>Git>Create pull request - First time it asked me to create a sync/remote link.
11. Base fork=Angelsone/test (the project I forked FROM), Base branch: master (which of Angelsone's branches I want him to merge my changes to)
12. All going well, Aggelos gets the pull request and merges it on GitHub (not easy to do the merge on Android studio)
13. If there are conflicts for merge, GitHub tells you to download the file and compare - this is more complex - follow GitHub instructions
